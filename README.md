# Collection of ML Algorithms implemented on amazing datasets

## Algorithms
- Decision Tree
- KNN
- DBSCAN 
- DIANA (Divisive Clustering)

## Clustering Project

- It involves data visualization aspect of FIFA dataset including :
	- histograms of count of players on the basis of some attributes like height.
	- Distribution of players in different clubs/country on the basis of some attribute.
	- Features of players according to their position.
	- outliers like Ronaldo and Messi.
- K-means
	- Implement k-means clustering algorithm from scratch.
	- Using elbow method and Silhouette Score to get optimal number of clusters.
- Hierarchical Clustering
	- Clustering the data using any Agglomerative(bottom-up strategy).
	- Clustering the data using any divisive hierarchical clustering method (top-down strategy).
- DBSCAN
